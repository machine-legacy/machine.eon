Specifications I would like to write...

No types from Namespaces [A,B,C] should use types in namespaces [D,E,F] (but the inverse is allowed)
Types using Types [A] should only be Types [B,C,D]
Types using Methods [A] should only be Types [B,C,D]
Types using Methods [A] should only be Methods [B,C,D]

Get nodes using any setter of any property of any type in specific namespace A
